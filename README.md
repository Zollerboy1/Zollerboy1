### Hi there ;)

My name is Josef.

Currently I'm studying Computer Science at ETH Zürich in Switzerland.

I'm interested in programming and computer science since several years now and mostly I just do random projects (and never really finish them) whenever there is something new I wanna try out.

My proudest project so far, although it's still extremely far from reaching a working version 1.0, is the [*juice* programming language](juicelang.org), written in C++. If you want to collaborate, you're more than welcome to.

Until *juice* is finally usable, the best programming language existing is definitely and undeniably Swift.

Fun fact: I currently have 464 files and folders floating around on my Desktop – with a rising trend (thank you stacks feature for saving my day^^).

Take a look at my GitHub stats:

My most used languages are saying more than thousand words, I guess:
