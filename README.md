### Hi there ;)

My name is Josef.

Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at ETH Zürich in Switzerland.

I've been interested in programming and computer science for several years now. I mostly do random projects (and never really finish them) whenever there is something new I want to try out.

My proudest project so far, although it's still extremely far from reaching a working version 1.0, is the [*juice* programming language](https://juicelang.org), originally written in C++, but a rewrite in Rust is underway. If you want to collaborate, you're more than welcome to.

Until *juice* is finally usable, the best programming language existing is definitely and undeniably Swift (although I've been using Rust more and more in the last couple of months).

Fun fact: I currently have 368 files and folders floating around on my Desktop (thank you stacks feature for saving my day^^) – however, the number seems to be steadily falling now (have I actually become more organized these days?).

Take a look at my GitHub stats:

My most used languages are saying more than a thousand words, I guess:
